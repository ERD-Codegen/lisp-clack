# ![CL tiny-routes RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

#### *** Work in Progress ***

### [tiny-routes](https://github.com/jeko2000/tiny-routes) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[tiny-routes](https://github.com/jeko2000/tiny-routes)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[tiny-routes](https://github.com/jeko2000/tiny-routes)** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

Once complete, this will be a [clack](https://github.com/fukamachi/clack) application built using [tiny-routes](https://github.com/jeko2000/tiny-routes) library.

# Getting started

TBD
